ok listen this is VERY important topic
this is asked A LOT in interviews in india specially last 2 years after turborepo came full trend.

I will explain like child
super simple + full stack dev angle
and after that 1 real interview style explanation also.

---

## first… what is **monorepo**?

mono = single
repo = repository (github / gitlab / bitbucket etc)

### monorepo means

> ALL your projects / apps / packages / frontend / backend etc inside **one single repo**.

example:

```
polybond/
  apps/
     frontend-react
     admin-panel
     backend-nest
  packages/
     ui-component-library
     utils
     auth-lib
```

Everything lives together
1 git repo
1 codebase
shared code possible
no need to copy-paste utils everywhere.

This is very good for full stack developers because
you don’t need to move 200 repos and search where code is.

---

## why monorepo is useful?

* code sharing becomes easy
* versioning same
* single CI/CD pipeline
* team collaboration easier
* refactoring is easier (change lib in one place → all apps get it)

---

## but monorepo problem

* build becomes slow
* dependency graph becomes huge
* many apps inside makes it heavy

so we need tooling to manage monorepo properly

---

## and now…

## Turborepo

Turborepo is a **tool** (from Vercel) to manage monorepos efficiently.

it gives

* build caching
* task pipeline
* parallel / incremental builds
* remote cache (so your team builds once → others don’t recompile same again)
* works perfectly with Next.js

This is why turborepo is the most famous monorepo tool now.

Think like this:

> Monorepo is the concept
> Turborepo is the engine to run monorepo fast

## super small kid friendly summary

| thing     | explanation                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Monorepo  | One big school having all classes in one building                              |
| Turborepo | School management system that makes this school run smooth, fast and organized |

---

## for full stack developer point of view

using monorepo + turborepo means:

* frontend + backend + shared components + shared utils = all in one place
* deploy easier
* cross team collaboration easier (FE + BE same repo)
* reduced duplication
* easier microservices management inside same repo

---

## interview 2 line definition (use this exact)

> Monorepo is a single repository that contains multiple projects / apps / packages that share code together. Turborepo is a high-performance build system for monorepos that provides caching, parallel execution and incremental builds so monorepos become fast and easy to maintain.

this line alone is enough to impress interviewer.
